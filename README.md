# Stata: Visualizing intersection points between (two lines) the reference and a trend line
The Stata code determines intercept points between a reference and any form of trend line. This also applied to area plots and others.

The code works in a manner that allows you to identify all points intersecting with the reference line of your choice. It also helps extract X values on which the line intersects with the reference line which in some cases is useful for the user.

The code also uses "Slope" to interpolate the intercept point between the actual points just above and below the reference.
